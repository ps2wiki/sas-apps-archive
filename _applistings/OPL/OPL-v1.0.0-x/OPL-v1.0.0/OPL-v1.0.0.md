Open PS2 Loader (OPL) is a 100% Open source game and application loader for the PS2 and PS3 units. It supports five categories of devices: USB mass storage devices, MX4SIO (SD card connected to memory card port via adapter), iLink (SBP2 compliant storage devices via IEE1394), SMBv1 shares and the PlayStation 2 HDD unit. USB/SMB/MX4SIO/iLink support both USBExtreme and *.ISO formats while PS2 HDD supports HDLoader format, all devices also support ZSO format (compressed ISO). It's now the most compatible homebrew loader.  

OPL is developed continuously - anyone can contribute improvements to the project due to its open-source nature.
